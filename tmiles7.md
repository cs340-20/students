## About me

My name is Tucker Miles and I am a junior computer science student here at the University of Tennessee.
I began working in enterprise tech at First Horizon Bank this past summer, and will be leaving
them to work for Pilot Flying J this upcoming summer. In my free time, I enjoy coding, golfing, and running.
