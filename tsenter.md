### Tyler Senter
I am a second year computer science student here at UTK, with a focus in cypersecurity. Thanks in part to my two jobs this semester, I have no life outside of schoolwork. When I do have time outside of classwork, I like to work on [my own website](https://utk.tylersenter.com) and other projects, such as [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
