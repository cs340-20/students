I am Brian Horsburgh, a sophomore from Tampa, Florida. I am a huge fan a of UT sports and have played soccer my whole life.
I spend a lot of my time playing video games, especially Rocket League and Halo. I will be doing my first semester as a TA
gregor in CS130 and working as a peer mentor coordinator for the office of first year studies.
