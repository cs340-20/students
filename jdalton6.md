I have a decent background in computers, coding, technology, etc.  I like working with Linux (preference for Arch) and dabble in networking.  I have experience with HTML, Fortran, C++, Python, and Bash scripting.  I prefer working from the command line whenever reasonably possible.  I originally transferred into Computer Science from Nuclear Engineering (where I worked with Fortran).  I have a large variety of interests and am always seeking new opportunities for learning and experience.
