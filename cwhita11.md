My name is Alex Whitaker. I am a Senior in Computer Engineering and a member of Air Force ROTC. I love coding and seeing my ideas come to life.
I enjoy small, practical coding projects that can be used in every-day life, but I am excited to challenge myself with a large scale project
in a real world environment.
